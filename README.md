## 7. <i class="icon-pencil"></i>Design
-------------

Two low-fidelity paper prototype and one high-fidelity digital prototype have been created so far by using proto.io and sketch.
Our last digital prototype was sufficent to kickstart our development process, thus we'll be following our latest design template as a guide can be found [**here**](https://pr.to/3ASLD1/)
